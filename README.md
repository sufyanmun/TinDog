Reflection: Working on this project was a great opportunity for me to learn and apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I enjoyed the creative process of designing and building. I got exposed to Colour Theory, Typography, and the importance of UI/UX. 

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the website was making it responsive across different screen sizes. To overcome this challenge, I learned the use of Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout.

Another challenge I encountered was styling the website. I had to experiment with different CSS properties and values to get the desired look and feel. In the end, I was able to create a visually appealing website that met the project requirements.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience and I am proud of the final product.
